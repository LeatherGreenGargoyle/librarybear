# librarybear
LibraryBear is a book search-and-saving app, enabling users to query books from the https://openlibrary.org API, and save
books of interest to an in-app wishlist.

## Installation
To open LibraryBear in XCode, simply clone the repo onto your local machine. Then in XCode, navigate into the LibraryBear
directory, and open the file LibraryBear.xcworkspace. To run the app in a simulator, navigate into the LibraryBear directory
from the terminal and run 'pod install' (make sure you have cocoapods installed!). After all pods are installed, you will
be able to run the app on a simulator, or on a hardware device.
